"""Which session a request declares it belongs to.

``api_logs.session_id`` -- and the ``(session_id, timestamp DESC)`` index over
it -- exists so one conversation's requests can be pulled out of the firehose,
and RouteWise's prefix-cache cost adjustment scopes its warm entries on the
same value. Both were built around ``X-Session-ID``, the gateway's own header,
and both were empty for exactly the traffic they are most useful on, because no
coding agent sent that header. Some now send one of their own -- Claude Code
sends ``x-claude-code-session-id`` -- but never the gateway's. A Claude Code
session is hundreds of requests, and every one of them logged
``session_id = NULL``.

Those requests are not anonymous, though. Each agent already carries a session
identifier of its own, in its own idiom, and this module reads whichever idiom
the client used:

* ``X-Session-ID`` -- the gateway's own contract. Wins whenever it is present.
* ``session-id`` / ``thread-id`` request headers -- what Codex CLI stamps on the
  ``/v1/responses`` requests it sends. The underscore spellings are accepted
  beside them: header names may contain underscores, but it is unusual enough
  that intermediaries drop such headers by default (nginx does), so a client
  can sensibly send either.
* ``x-session-affinity`` / ``x-opencode-session`` -- OpenCode and its Kilo Code
  fork. Both already send ``X-Session-Id`` alongside the affinity header on any
  provider they do not recognise as their own, so the canonical source usually
  wins first; these are read because one arriving without the other means the
  session is still knowable.
* ``metadata.session_id`` / ``client_metadata.session_id`` in the request body
  -- a client that declares the session where it declares everything else.
  Codex uses ``client_metadata``.
* ``x-claude-code-session-id`` -- Claude Code's own header, a bare UUID it
  sends on every request. Purpose-built for this and needing no inference, so
  it is the strongest source after the gateway's own header.
* ``metadata.user_id`` in the request body -- Claude Code packs the device, the
  account and the run into this one Anthropic field. Two shapes: current
  clients (>= 2.1.78) send a JSON object whose ``session_id`` member is the
  run, and older ones sent ``user_<hash>_account_<uuid>_session_<uuid>``, where
  the trailing ``_session_`` segment was the run. Both are read; the source
  says which.

The source is reported alongside the value and recorded as
``metadata.session_id_source``, because these are not equally strong claims: a
value read out of Claude Code's composite user id was *inferred* from a format
nobody promised us, and an operator looking at a suspicious grouping needs to
know that without re-deriving it.

Trust: every source here is client-declared, ``X-Session-ID`` included. Nothing
is authorized, billed, or rate-limited by a session id -- it labels log rows and
scopes a prefix-cache warm entry that is *already* keyed on the caller's own
affinity key, so one caller's declaration cannot reach another's. What a
declaration can still do is land an unbounded string in an indexed column, so
:func:`normalize_session_id` bounds the length and rejects control characters,
uniformly across sources. The Claude Code parse is stricter still -- it accepts
only an id-shaped trailing segment -- because we inferred that one rather than
being told it.
